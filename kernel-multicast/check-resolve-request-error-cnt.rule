/*
 * This rule helps in monitoring the health of the system on the basis of the resolve request error count parameter.

 * The sensor used is open-config.
 * The rule throws red alarm if the resolve request error count is more than 20.
 * The rule throws yellow alarm if the resolve request error count is in the range 11-20.
