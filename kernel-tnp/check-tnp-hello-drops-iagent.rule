/*
 * This rule monitors the health of the system with the help of the tnp hello drop count parameter.

 * It uses iAgent sensor.
 * The rule throws red alarm if the tnp hello drop count is above 100. 
 * It throws yellow alarm if the tnp hello drop count is in the range 10-100.
 * Else, the system is in a healthy condition.
