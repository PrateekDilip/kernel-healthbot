/*
 * This rule monitors the system health on the basis of the tnp fragment drop count parameter.

 * iAgent sensor is used here.
 * The rule throws red alarm if the tnp fragment drop count is above 1000.
 * Yellow alarm is thrown if the tnp fragment drop count is in the range 100-1000.
 * Else, the system is in a healthy condition.
